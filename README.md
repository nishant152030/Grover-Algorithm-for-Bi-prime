# Grover-Algorithm-for-Bi-primes
## Project Overview
Grover's algorithm, also known as the quantum search algorithm, is a quantum algorithm that can be used to find a solution to a specific problem. It runs an unstructured search that finds with high probability the unique input to a black box function that produces a particular output value, using just ùëÇ(ùëÅ) evaluations of the function, where ùëÅ is the size of the function's domain. It was devised by Lov Grover in 1996It involves using an oracle, which is part of the quantum circuitry, to flip the phase of the correct solution. This requires writing a specific algorithm for the problem at hand. While Grover's algorithm is powerful, it may not be practical to use in all situations.<br>

This project is an implementation of grover's algorithm to find bi-primes. All things are explained in the notebook itself.
